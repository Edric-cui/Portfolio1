# Welcome to my portfolio

{% include carousel.html %}

#### This is Jiachen, a designer.

<br>

Here is a collection of my works that I'd like to share with you.

This website is also a part of my portfolio, which I built on GitHub with Jekyll. It is **static**, **responsive**, **markdown-based** and **light-weight**.

I structured this site with HTML and styled it with CSS, with a pinch of JavaScript. Bucause this website is markdown-based, it can be maintained quickly and easily – all I need is a text editor and internet.

**This site is under continuous updates.**
