## I’m Jiachen, a product designer focused on complex systems and design infrastructure.
{:class="tagline"}

I design UX for data-rich, system-heavy products — things like data analytics platforms, design system, developer tools, and shared UX frameworks.

**Snapshot**

- Product design across health tech, SaaS, and data platforms
- Deep experience with design systems, tokens, and shared UX patterns
- Hands-on builder — I code and maintain this site with Jekyll, HTML/CSS, and a bit of JavaScript
- Modern workflow — I use AI-assisted tooling (e.g. Cursor, Vercel) in my day-to-day design/frontend work


**About this site**

This portfolio runs on Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub Pages. It started as a fully hand-coded project, but today it’s a mix of manual work and AI-assisted iteration: I use Cursor’s agent with prompts to generate/refactor pieces, then I review, edit, and polish the code by hand.

I treat AI as a collaborator, not autopilot — I keep the architecture and UX decisions intentional, and I’ll refactor until the HTML/CSS and interactions match the design. It’s a small but realistic version of how I collaborate with engineers: fast iteration, tight feedback loops, and clean implementation.
