## I’m Jiachen, a product designer focused on complex systems and design infrastructure.

I design UX for data-rich, system-heavy products — things like data analytics platforms, design system, developer tools, and shared UX frameworks.

**Snapshot**

- Product design across health tech, SaaS, and data platforms
- Deep experience with design systems, tokens, and shared UX patterns
- Hands-on builder — I code and maintain this site with Jekyll, HTML/CSS, and a bit of JavaScript
- Modern workflow — I use AI-assisted tooling (e.g. Cursor, Vercel) in my day-to-day design/frontend work


**About this site**

This is v1 of my portfolio, hand-built on GitHub Pages using Jekyll, HTML/CSS, and a little JavaScript.  
It’s static, responsive, and markdown-based, so I can version it like code and update content quickly.

In parallel, I’m working on a new version using a modern frontend stack and AI-assisted coding (Cursor, Vercel, etc.).  
For now, this site is the source of truth for my work.
