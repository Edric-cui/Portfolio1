### Background

The data was first collected via a Python-based toolset deployed on a VPS server. The toolset utilises Twitter API to capture live data from Twitter according to certain filters I set up. The next step is to organise and analyse the data in R Studio, refining input and format before being visualised. Then the refined data are exported to Gephi for visualisation.
