## Market Research - Smart TV Market Overview (2018)
<details markdown="1">

<summary>
Expand/Hide
</summary>

**Market trend**

- **Apple TV is not available in China, and unlikely to become available anytime soon.**

- The smart TV market has a relatively large user base and is still growing rapidly at this stage (total number of smart TV users: 148 million units were activated at the end of 2017, 2018 Q1 ownership growth rate was 6%, and activation volume growth rate was 11%.

![TV Market]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/tvapp/tvmarket trend.png){:class="img-responsive"}

  - There is no popular first-party (content producer) App in China, such as Netflix, BBC (BBC iPlayer), HBO GO, etc. Moreover, in foreign markets, most TV apps with high downloads and huge revenue are supported by strong content. For example, the main content of YouTube is UGC, while Netflix, BBC, and HBO are PGC+IP (original series/movies).

**User Usage**
- The average user usage time is 4-5 hours a day, light users mainly use it at night, and heavy users will use it all day during the day. Holidays will be more active.

![TV Market]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/tvapp/tvmarket netflix.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}

**User Portrait**
  - Majority part of the users were born in the 80s and 90s. The family structure is dominated by singles and small nuclear families with up to three members. There are more users in east China.

**Overview of video-on-demand app on TV**
  - Video-on-demand is the one of the most important user demands. Among them, entertainment content such as films, series, and celebrity shows are most popular. They account for more than half of total TV app downloads. Among top 100 on-demand apps in Dangbei Market are content-mixed platforms. The top 10 tend to be TV versions of their mobile apps (Tencent, iQiyi, Youku, etc.).

**Short video app overview**
  - The user base of short video TV apps is still relatively small (on mobile this number is increasing rapidly). This type of app mainly focuses on vertical content, most being news and sports content. There are also some popular TV apps focusing on games and anime. Fitness-based video apps have also gained popularity, such as sports, yoga, and dancing. **Learning-oriented video apps are mainly about pre-school education.**

**TV App Market Overview**
  - It's totally chaotic. The mainstream app download markets include Xiaomi TV App Store, Aliyun App Market, Chipper Market, Dangbei Market, Sofa Manager, etc. The markets of Xiaomi and Ali are more mature but are limited to certain manufacturer. You can find hundreds of bad-quality apps, and even malware apps in these markets.

  - The design of most apps is still in the exploratory stage, and there is no consistent experience. Different apps tend to have different interaction modes/remote layouts, resulting in a steep learning curve for new users.

**Summary**
  - The Smart TV market has a huge user base, rapid growth, long user comsumption time, and concentrated user behaviour. This market has important strategic significance for the long-term development of video distribution/production .

  - At present, the backbone of large-screen Internet users is the 26-35 year-olds in economically developed provinces, which basically coincides with the target users of our knowledge-based short video app.

  - The consumption of video content on the big screen is still dominated by entertainment content such as film, series, and celebrity shows, while short video apps are relatively less consumed.

  - The market segment of short knowledge videos is still a blue ocean, but it also means that the market needs to be cultivated with high-quality content, fresh and easy-to-use interactive experience, and time.

  - Most of the existing video content on the big screen is produced by the professionals (film, series, celebrity show production companies). This means that large-screen TV users have high expectations for the quality of content on this platform.

  - Therefore, to focus on learning-oriented short videos, we must provide high-quality content, instead of going for "quantity no quality".

</summary>

We started interviews with families and friends. As part of user research. we created assumptions based on our own experience and interview results.

A total of 26 people were interviewed by 4 designers. We consolidated the results as follow.

### Assumption 1: New grads to workplace

- Interaction is inconsistent from TV to mobile app

**Usage scenarios**
- Evening after work, and leisure time on weekends
- Connect to a computer to watch movies, TV series, etc. (especially foreign movies and TV series that are not available on domestic video platforms) (pirate)

**Design opportunities**

- Like MasterClass, learning and studying videos are can be combined with celebrities, such as Zhou Yiwei, Zhang Yi and other famous actors talking about acting. Luo Ji Thinking and Round Table School focus on thinking methodologies , and Readers focuses on reading and fictions. They are targets we aim, and can be distributed to specific user division in our TV app.

- From another perspective, users' needs may rise on a certain occasion. For example, before traveling, users tend to have high demands for destinations and guides. For fitness, please refer to  celebrities' fitness training videos, etc.

- The interaction should be consistent with mobile apps, or even use the smartphone as a remote

**Summary**

- **This part of the population is a strong part of potential user groups, and key profit contributor. They have high expectations for TV APP and high willingness to use it**

### Hypothesis 3: Those who live with their parents

**User Traits**
- For such users, watching TV is an important way for them to accompany their parents, so the content selection and usage habits of TV will be based on the wishes of their parents. When they need to watch the content they are interested in, they usually choose to watch it on a mobile phone, ipad or computer

### QHorizon

<summary>

</summary>

**Type of competition: Indirect**

**Product Positioning**

- It is officially positioned as a short video interactive community sharing application on the TV side, but in fact the interaction at this stage is very limited, only likes and attention
- We position its product as [PGC + integration] short video platform

**Product Features**

- Recommend popular original content
- Play videos according to categories
- Play videos according to topics
- Recommend videos based on views
- Like the video
- Follow a topic
- Play history

**Structure**

![Q视界功能结构图]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/tvapp/qshijie.png){:class="img-responsive"}

**Interaction/Visual**
- Use black as the background color, so that the interface will be suitable in a dark environment, taking into account the night use environment of TV
- The interaction is simple and easy to understand, the UI is clean, and with play history, but lacks time information
- Like, follow, and make appointments without registration (not completed)
- No search function, category does not cover all programs,
- The style of each block is not uniform and appears messy, and there are too many details, such as alignment, color and font
- The functional structure is not clearly defined, for example, "Hot Topics" does not correspond to an obvious topic entry, and the classification label does not correspond to the information flow classification name of the main interface, causing  confusion

**Content**
- There is little original content, mainly videos collected from the Internet
- Part of the content is the trailer or promotional film of the original program, although it is short, it does not provide the audience with the entrance to watch the full version

**Conclusion**
- We can learn from its recommendation system. The history function needs to be placed in an obvious place and needs time information. Classification needs to be concise and clear

## Operation Analysis
<details markdown="1">

<summary>
Expand/Hide
</summary>

**"Content is King"**

- Video TV apps must include sufficient content, from movies, celebrity shows, TV series, documentaries and other forms of content
- TV apps need to stay advantageous in film and television procurement, such as iQiyi's, Netflix's, Hulu's original series.
- Have original PGC, clear classification, and of course content quality

**Distribution Channel**

- Cooperate with TV manufacturers to acquire original users and expand app installations

**Refined operation-user tag management**

- In an era driven by refined operations, the basis of refined operations is to understand users and what they want, thereby improving operational efficiency
- User tags are the tagging of user information. In simple terms, they use some strong general vocabulary to describe or describe user characteristics, interests and hobbies
- After the user tag management system is set up, it means that the user portrait has been formed. The operation cooperates with the user information tag to group users with similar tags into a group, and conduct more flexible and targeted marketing activities for them

**Recommendation Mechanism**

- Through big data and recommendation engine, recommend different content to users who may be interested in them
- You can refer to YouTube's automatic playlist system to make users interested in watching continuously
- Recommend programs through program ranking, guess what you like, friends watching, and interactive games
- The user can subscribe to a certain author or column. After he subscribes, any updated information or broadcast information will be notified to the user in real time to increase the viewing time of his startup

**Activity**
- Increase the enthusiasm of users to pay through preferential activities and member promotions
- Promotion and promotion through festival activities

## SWOT analysis

<details markdown="1">

<summary>
Expand/Hide
</summary>

***S***
- The positioning of our product is unique, with few direct competitors
- There is original PGC to attract audience
- Informative topics cater to the needs of specific audience groups
- Knowledge-based topics are more consistent with TV use scenarios (relaxation, willingness to listen, longer free time, no frequent operation and interaction)
- Focus on vertical content, no need to search for interesting topics
- Add interesting interactive experience between programs, highlighting the concept of family interaction

***W***
- Using the app as the entrance will cause some potential users (interested but not strong) to leave, because they needs to go through 3 steps: searching, installing, and learning to use our TV app
- Slow update of original content
- Compared with the mobile and the web, TV has a disadvantage in the form of short videos, because short videos are more suitable for occupying fragmented time, so watching short videos on mobile terminals is more popular

***O***
- Different from foreign markets, the China market does not have a dominant broadcasting platform (YouTube, Podcast) for intellectual content. Small but sophisticated brands such as "Logical Thinking", "Creative Agency", "Zhihu Live" tend to avoid expansion to TV. The audience would have high acceptance
- Because the content is focused, there are fewer core functions and fewer restrictions, so you have the opportunity to develop a more beautiful UI and convenient interaction than similar apps

***T***
- Large platforms such as Tencent Video, iQiyi, and Youku also have knowledge topics and will seize a portion of the market
- PGC producers may choose multiple platforms to publish content at the same time
- The amount of exclusive content depends on the competitiveness of the platform, and the initial update speed may be too slow

## Persona

> **I wish to highlight this part as I used statistical methods to analyse interview findings, which is a efficient way to help the team reach consensus**

First, quantify the answers from user interviews before statistical analysis can be performed.

I used the K-means Cluster algorithm to measure the geometric distance between users (R studio). Then, the outliers that are removed, by adjustign K value, the nodes with similar distances are divided into one cluster. 3 clusters represent 3 user groups. According to the analysis hypothesis of the user group in the early stage, it is further integrated into 2 groups and 2 usage scenarios.

![exported chart 01]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/tvapp/k means cluster.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

The degree of matching between persona and user group assumptions is very high, which supports the previous user research assumptions. Then I continued to create a journey map based on personas.

Single-person usage scenarios emphasise personal experience and accurate content search. This scene is the main use scenario and is also a high frequency scenario for the target user.

![persona 1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/tvapp/persona-1.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Family use scenarios, emphasising family experience and content recommendation. This scenario is a secondary use scenario, and is the main scenario for expanding the user scale in the later stage of the product.

## Interaction Design
Interaction description and user flow. The interactive instructions are made according to the remote control/smart phones.

> Note that the author edric is me, I contributed 80%+ of the interaction and mockup designs

The interaction follows Google's Android TV guideline because most smart TVs in China equipped with Android. Follwing Android guideline is also the best way to ensure performance and smoothness.

AppleTV's interaction with iPhone, and touch-wheel  were also used as a reference.
