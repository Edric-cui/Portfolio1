**Market trend**

- **Apple TV is not available in China, and unlikely to become available anytime soon.**

- The smart TV market has a relatively large user base and is still growing rapidly at this stage (total number of smart TV users: 148 million units were activated at the end of 2017, 2018 Q1 ownership growth rate was 6%, and activation volume growth rate was 11%.

![TV Market]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/tvapp/tvmarket trend.png){:class="img-responsive"}

  - There is no popular first-party (content producer) App in China, such as Netflix, BBC (BBC iPlayer), HBO GO, etc. Moreover, in foreign markets, most TV apps with high downloads and huge revenue are supported by strong content. For example, the main content of YouTube is UGC, while Netflix, BBC, and HBO are PGC+IP (original series/movies).

**User Usage**
- The average user usage time is 4-5 hours a day, light users mainly use it at night, and heavy users will use it all day during the day. Holidays will be more active.

**User Portrait**
  - Majority part of the users were born in the 80s and 90s. The family structure is dominated by singles and small nuclear families with up to three members. There are more users in east China.

**Overview of video-on-demand app on TV**
  - Video-on-demand is the one of the most important user demands. Among them, entertainment content such as films, series, and celebrity shows are most popular. They account for more than half of total TV app downloads. Among top 100 on-demand apps in Dangbei Market are content-mixed platforms. The top 10 tend to be TV versions of their mobile apps (Tencent, iQiyi, Youku, etc.).

**Short video app overview**
  - The user base of short video TV apps is still relatively small (on mobile this number is increasing rapidly). This type of app mainly focuses on vertical content, most being news and sports content. There are also some popular TV apps focusing on games and anime. Fitness-based video apps have also gained popularity, such as sports, yoga, and dancing. **Learning-oriented video apps are mainly about pre-school education.**

**TV App Market Overview**
  - It's totally chaotic. The mainstream app download markets include Xiaomi TV App Store, Aliyun App Market, Chipper Market, Dangbei Market, Sofa Manager, etc. The markets of Xiaomi and Ali are more mature but are limited to certain manufacturer. You can find hundreds of bad-quality apps, and even malware apps in these markets.

  - The design of most apps is still in the exploratory stage, and there is no consistent experience. Different apps tend to have different interaction modes/remote layouts, resulting in a steep learning curve for new users.

**Summary**
  - The Smart TV market has a huge user base, rapid growth, long user comsumption time, and concentrated user behaviour. This market has important strategic significance for the long-term development of video distribution/production .

  - At present, the backbone of large-screen Internet users is the 26-35 year-olds in economically developed provinces, which basically coincides with the target users of our knowledge-based short video app.

  - The consumption of video content on the big screen is still dominated by entertainment content such as film, series, and celebrity shows, while short video apps are relatively less consumed.

  - The market segment of short knowledge videos is still a blue ocean, but it also means that the market needs to be cultivated with high-quality content, fresh and easy-to-use interactive experience, and time.

  - Most of the existing video content on the big screen is produced by the professionals (film, series, celebrity show production companies). This means that large-screen TV users have high expectations for the quality of content on this platform.

  - Therefore, to focus on learning-oriented short videos, we must provide high-quality content, instead of going for "quantity no quality".
