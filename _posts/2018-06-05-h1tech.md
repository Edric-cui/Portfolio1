## TL;DR

- Designed a **web-based automation dashboard** for greenhouse IoT devices and their control strategies
- Worked as the product designer, covering information architecture, key flows, and visual design with the founder and firmware team
- Turned a board-level, hardware-centric setup into a **farm-based mental model** (programs/projects/devices) and split expert vs everyday workflows
- Used **system-level flows** and a small set of representative screens to move fast and keep engineers aligned in a short engagement
- Focus of this project in my portfolio is **system-level IA and complex interaction design for a hardware-heavy product**

## Project background and my role

The client provides agricultural solutions based on IoT devices. Their main product is a control board that connects:

- **Sensors** (temperature, humidity, light, etc.)
- **Controllers** (heaters, irrigation, film rollers, and more)

Automation strategies run on top of these devices to keep conditions within range and alert staff when something deviates.

My role as **product designer** was to:

- Design a **web-based UI** for this automation system
- Create a **dashboard** that integrates information from many control boards across multiple greenhouses
- Work closely with the founder (domain expert) and firmware engineers

Given the short timeline, we prioritised:

- Getting the **core structure right**
- Designing a few **representative flows and screens** that could be extended later
- Documenting key **user journeys as flows** so engineers could implement reliably

---

## Key constraints that shaped the design

From early conversations and quick UX discovery, several constraints emerged:

- **Different user groups**  
  - Electronics engineers create presets and strategies  
  - Farm workers pause, override, or tweak parameters in the field

- **Two levels of complexity**  
  - Engineers need advanced controls  
  - Farm workers need simple, safe workflows

- **Batch operations**  
  - Devices are deployed in bulk; registration and checks must scale

- **Dashboard as primary monitoring and communication surface**  
  - Used by operators, visitors, and sometimes regulators, mainly for **monitoring and visualising data**, not heavy interaction

## Design highlights

### 1. Clarifying the system mental model (IA and navigation)

**Problem**

The initial model was hardware-centric: devices identified by board IDs, with strategies attached directly to them. This worked for engineers, but not for farm workers who think in terms of **greenhouses, crops, and projects**.

**Design**

I introduced a simple hierarchy:

- **Programs** – overall deployments or larger initiatives
- **Projects** – specific greenhouses, crops, or experiments
- **Devices** – the boards and sensors installed within each project

{: #img-caption}

To make this concrete, I designed a **tree view** that mirrors this hierarchy:

![Program and project tree views]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/h1tech/program tree view.png){:class="img-responsive"}
Application tree view that lets users browse from farms and projects down to individual devices and strategies
{: #img-caption}

This gave everyone a shared mental model:

- Engineers can still see devices and strategies
- Farm staff can start from “Greenhouse A – Tomatoes” rather than “Device #0321”

---

### 2. Scaling device onboarding (single and batch)

**Problem**

New deployments often involve **dozens of devices**. Doing everything manually for each board is slow and error-prone.

**Design**

I designed two flows:

- **Single-device registration** for small setups and quick tests
- **Batch registration** for larger rollouts

![Device registration (single device)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/h1tech/device reg single.png){:class="img-responsive"}
Single-device registration screen with clear fields, validation, and tags so devices stay searchable later
{: #img-caption}

![Device registration (batch operations)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/h1tech/device reg batch.png){:class="img-responsive"}
Batch registration screen for importing multiple device IDs, running self-checks, and applying naming and tagging rules at once
{: #img-caption}

Key decisions I made:

- Encourage **consistent naming and tagging** so devices are easier to find in the tree
- Add **batch self-checks** so operators can verify connectivity in one go
- Make it clear where each device will appear in the program/project structure

**Result (qualitative)**

- New greenhouses could be brought online with fewer manual steps
- The device list became cleaner and easier to navigate, which helped later when assigning strategies

### 3. Strategies for experts and everyday operators

**Problem**

Strategies are the core of the system (“if temperature > X and humidity < Y, then open vents and start irrigation”). But:

- Engineers need **full control** over logic
- Farm workers just need to **run safe presets** and adjust a few parameters

Mixing these needs in one UI risked misconfiguration.

**Design**

I separated authoring vs usage into a few focused screens:

1. **Creating basic strategies** for common scenarios, with guided fields and safe defaults

   ![Create a basic strategy]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/h1tech/create strategy basic.png){:class="img-responsive"}
   Basic strategy editor with predefined inputs and safe defaults aimed at non-expert users
   {: #img-caption}

2. **Creating advanced strategies** for engineers with more complex logic and variables

   ![Create an advanced strategy]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/h1tech/create strategy advanced.png){:class="img-responsive"}
   Advanced strategy editor for engineers to build more complex automations with custom logic
   {: #img-caption}

3. **Invoking strategies in projects**, where farm workers attach presets to a real greenhouse or project and tweak only the allowed parameters

   ![Invoke preset strategy in projects]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/h1tech/strategy invoke.png){:class="img-responsive"}
   Invoke screen for attaching a predefined strategy to a project while exposing only safe parameters for day-to-day adjustments
   {: #img-caption}

Design choices I led:

- Use **basic vs advanced** editors instead of a single, overloaded screen
- Keep structural logic read-only in the “invoke” step for non-experts
- Highlight which values are safe to change (e.g. thresholds) and which are locked

---

### 4. Dashboards for monitoring and communication

**Problem**

The dashboard has to work for:

- Operators in a control room
- Visitors and stakeholders walking past large displays
- Sometimes regulators looking at how conditions are tracked

**Design**

I created a modular dashboard with variants for different views:

![Dashboard with component variants]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/h1tech/dashboard var.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}
Dashboard layout concepts exploring different arrangements of status, alerts, and trend components
{: #img-caption}

For control rooms, we designed a **fullscreen mode**:

![Dashboard in fullscreen view mode]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/h1tech/fullscreen mode.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}
Fullscreen monitoring view optimised for large displays, emphasising alerts and overall system state
{: #img-caption}

The visual design aimed to:

- Use a **neutral, low-noise appearance** in normal conditions, so that alerts clearly stand out when something is wrong
- Use typography and layout that remain legible from a distance
- Avoid unnecessary controls on this screen, since it is mostly for **monitoring** rather than frequent action

## Design workflow and system flows

Even though the project was relatively small and fast, I still needed a clear way to **align with engineers** on how the system should behave end to end.

I created a set of **system flows** that:

- Describe the **user journeys** behind the main screens (device management, strategy management)
- Capture edge cases and state transitions that are hard to see from static mocks
- Help engineers and the founder confirm we had the same understanding before implementation

![Device registration and management flow]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/h1tech/flow device mgmt.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

{: #img-caption}

These flows were part of my **design workflow**: start from the IA, map real user journeys, and then design screens that fit into that bigger picture

## Outcomes (qualitative)

Because this was a relatively small, quick project, we didn’t set up full analytics. But from client feedback and rollout, we saw:

- **Clearer mental model**  
  - People started referring to programs and projects (greenhouses, crops) rather than only board IDs

- **Smoother onboarding**  
  - Operators used batch registration flows for new deployments instead of copying settings device by device

- **Safer daily operations**  
  - Engineers created strategies once; farm staff used presets and invoke screens to work within safe ranges

- **More convincing demos**  
  - The dashboard and fullscreen view made it easier for the client to explain the system to visitors and potential partners

---

## Self-reflection

- The clearest strengths of this project are the information architecture and the split between expert workflows and everyday operation
- If I revisited it, I would add basic telemetry and better strategy simulation so impact and safety are easier to validate
- Lightweight system flows were an effective way to communicate my design workflow and keep implementation aligned with engineers
- Next time I would bring measurement and mobile-friendly alert experiences into scope earlier, especially for on-site operators
