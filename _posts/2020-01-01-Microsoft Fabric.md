## What does it solve and who's it for?

Microsoft Fabric is a cloud SaaS platform that provides data solutions for enterprises. It solves the problem of having to use multiple tools and vendors for different analytics needs. Fabric provide **experiences** across the entirity of the data lifecycle, such as data engineering, science, analytics, and BI.

## As a part of Shared UX team

A Shared UX team is a type of UX team that helps build and maintain the infrastructure and cross-product experiences such as information architecture, navigation and hierarchy, etc. 

We also support the usage, scalability, accessibility of UX across different experiences under Fabric. 

Here are some challenges of this position:
- Ensuring the consistency and quality of UX standards and practices across different teams and projects.
- Balancing the needs and expectations of multiple product teams; balancing the degree of scalability (one-fits-all) as well as flexibility (case-by-case)
- Communicating and collaborating effectively with other UX designers and stakeholders.

To apparoch these challenges, I maintain closely synced with my teams, especially the design system team. 

We also have a pattern library with documentations and guidelines to help other product team designers stay consistent. Hence, Fabric will make customers feel like a single integrated platform.

##  Contribute to Fluent 2

Fluent 2 is the next version of Microsoftâ€™s design system.Many parts of it are still in design phase, and we are one of its contributors. This is a rare oppotunity for me because these general purpose and large design tend to revamp at long intervals. 

I learned a lot about design language and system by actively adopt, repurpose, review, and contribute to Fluent 2.

Here are some examples of my input:

### Tree (branch and nodes)

Reviewed usage cases and drag-and-drop behavior

Use case: File explorer

Layout and hierarchy 

![Tree node indentation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/fabric/tree.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Drag and drop interaction

1. Drag a node to a new position of the tree in the same level. 
1. Drag a node to a new location of the tree in a different level.
1. Drag a node into a container node. 
1. Drag a node to a new location outside of tree
1. Cancel drag.
1. Drag a node from outside and drop in the tree
1. Show disabled drop position (meaning this a certain area of the tree is not editable)

### Dialog/modal

Co-worked on guidelines for action layout

### TimePickers and DatePickers

Revamped styles and visuals


## Fabric design system

Fabric design system leverages Fluent 2 but focus more on for-business scenarios. 

Components and patterns

- Main navigation 
  - Redefined responsive and reflow behavior

- Notification system
  - Feedback and engagement

- Contextual menu 
  - Created a guideline for catagorizing menu options
  - Added variations for selection and multi-selection

- Monitoring hub

- Settings

- Filters


## Accessibility and responsive design examples

## Success measurement example 
- Qualitative
  - interview with customer 

- Quantitative
  - Telemetry

## How does AI (ChatGPT) become part of my daily work
- AI helps me generate content for user interfaces, such as text labels, buttons, menus, etc.
- AI also helps me evaluate the usability and accessibility of my designs, by comparing against design practices from a variety of similar products
- AI also helps me making some small design decisions by searching through matrure design guidelines and standards, so that I don't need to look them up like in a dictionary
