## What does it solve and who's it for?

Microsoft Fabric is a cloud SaaS platform that provides data solutions for enterprises. It solves the problem of having to use multiple tools and vendors for different analytics needs. Fabric provide **experiences** across the entirity of the data lifecycle, such as data engineering, science, analytics, and BI.

## As a part of Shared UX team

A Shared UX team is a type of UX team that helps build and maintain the infrastructure and cross-product experiences such as information architecture, navigation and hierarchy, etc. 

We also support the usage, scalability, accessibility of UX across different experiences under Fabric. 

Here are some challenges of this position:
- Ensuring the consistency and quality of UX standards and practices across different teams and projects.
- Balancing the needs and expectations of multiple product teams; balancing the degree of scalability (one-fits-all) as well as flexibility (case-by-case)
- Communicating and collaborating effectively with other UX designers and stakeholders.

To apparoch these challenges, I maintain closely synced with my teams, especially the design system team. 

We also have a pattern library with documentations and guidelines to help other product team designers stay consistent. Hence, Fabric will make customers feel like a single integrated platform.

##  Contribute to Fluent 2

Fluent 2 is the next version of Microsoftâ€™s design system.Many parts of it are still in design phase, and we are one of its contributors. This is a rare oppotunity for me because these general purpose and large design tend to revamp at long intervals. 

I learned a lot about design language and system by actively adopt, repurpose, review, and contribute to Fluent 2.

Here are some areas with my input:

- Tree (branch and nodes)

  - Reviewed use cases and drag-and-drop behavior

<!--- 
Use case: File explorer

Layout and hierarchy

Drag and drop interaction

1. Drag a node to a new position of the tree in the same level. 
1. Drag a node to a new location of the tree in a different level.
1. Drag a node into a container node. 
1. Drag a node to a new location outside of tree
1. Cancel drag.
1. Drag a node from outside and drop in the tree
1. Show disabled drop position (meaning this a certain area of the tree is not editable)

- Dialog/modal

  - Co-worked on layourt and usage guidelines.

- TimePickers and DatePickers

  - Revamped styles and visuals of the component.


## Fabric design system

Fabric design system leverages Fluent 2 with more focus on our product-specific scenarios. 

**Components and patterns**

- Top header navigation 
  - Redefined responsive and reflow behavior

- Notification system
  - Decision trees that help other designers make better decisions
  - Provide real-time and async feedback to users
  - Facilate user engagement with Fabric product

- Contextual menu 
  - Created a guideline to catagorize menu options for better clarity
  - Added variations for single-selection and multi-selection
  - Extended its functionality with searchable options and customizable range

- Monitoring hub
  - A centralized place to view and track activities across different products
  - Information is highly centralized and interlinked, but still clear and relevant to users

- Settings
  - The first place users tend to seek for various configurations
  - Provides high level of scalability to house settings options from other products

- Filters


## Accessibility and responsive design

- Keyboard navigation (Tab navigation)

- Reflow of page layout and elements until 320*256px. 

- Work with engineers to meet accessibility requirments like ARIA attributes and properties (Roles, Landmarks, Headings, etc.)

## How does AI (ChatGPT) become part of my daily work
- AI helps me generate content for user interfaces, such as text labels, buttons, menus, etc.
- AI also helps me evaluate the usability and accessibility of my designs, by comparing against design practices from a variety of similar products
- AI also helps me making some small design decisions by searching through matrure design guidelines and standards, so that I don't need to look them up like in a dictionary
