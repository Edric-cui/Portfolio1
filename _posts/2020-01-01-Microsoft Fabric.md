## What is Microsoft Fabric and who benefits from it?

Microsoft Fabric is a cloud SaaS platform that offers data solutions for enterprises. It simplifies the data analytics process by integrating different tools and vendors in one platform. Fabric covers the whole data lifecycle, from data engineering and science to analytics and business intelligence.

## My role in the Shared UX team

I work in the Shared UX team, which is responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure and cross-product experiences for Fabric. This includes aspects such as information architecture, navigation, and hierarchy. 

Our team also ensures that the UX of Fabric is consistent, scalable, and accessible across different experiences. 

Some of the challenges that I face in this role are:
- Upholding the UX standards and practices across different teams and projects.
- Balancing the needs and expectations of multiple product teams; finding the right trade-off between scalability (one-fits-all) and flexibility (case-by-case)
- Communicating and collaborating effectively with other UX designers and stakeholders.

To overcome these challenges, I keep in close sync with my teams, especially the design system team. 

We also have a pattern library with documentations and guidelines to help other product team designers follow the same UX principles. This way, Fabric can provide a seamless and integrated experience for customers.

##  Contribute to Fluent 2

## My contribution to Fluent 2

Fluent 2 is the next version of Microsoftâ€™s design system. It is still under development, and I am one of its contributors. This is a rare opportunity for me because these general purpose and large design systems usually change after long periods of time. 

I learned a lot about design language and system by actively adopting, repurposing, reviewing, and contributing to Fluent 2.

Here are some areas with my input:

- Tree (branch and nodes)

  - Analyzed use cases and drag-and-drop functionality

<!--- 
Use case: File explorer

Layout and hierarchy

Drag and drop interaction

1. Drag a node to a new position of the tree in the same level. 
1. Drag a node to a new location of the tree in a different level.
1. Drag a node into a container node. 
1. Drag a node to a new location outside of tree
1. Cancel drag.
1. Drag a node from outside and drop in the tree
1. Show disabled drop position (meaning this a certain area of the tree is not editable)

- Dialog/modal

  - Worked on layout and usage guidelines.

- TimePickers and DatePickers

  - Updated styles and visuals of the component.


## Fabric design system

Fabric design system leverages Fluent 2 with more focus on our product-specific scenarios. 

**Components and patterns**

- Top header navigation 
  - Redefined responsive and reflow behavior

- Notification system
  - Created decision trees to help designers choose the best options
  - Designed feedback mechanisms for users
  - Enhanced user engagement with Fabric product

- Contextual menu 
  - Developed a guideline to organize menu options for better clarity
  - Added variations for single-selection and multi-selection
  - Expanded its functionality with searchable options and customizable range

- Monitoring hub
  - Designed a central place to monitor and manage activities across different products
  - Organized information in a clear and relevant way for users

- Settings
  - Settings will become the first place users go to for various configurations
  - Ensured high level of scalability to accommodate settings options from other products

- Filters


## Accessibility and responsive design

- Keyboard navigation (Tab navigation)

- Reflow of page layout and elements until 320*256px. 

- Work with engineers to meet accessibility standards like ARIA attributes and properties (Roles, Landmarks, Headings, etc.)

## How does AI (ChatGPT) become part of my daily work
- AI assists me in creating content for user interfaces, such as text labels, buttons, menus, etc.
- AI also helps me assess the usability and accessibility of my designs, by comparing them with design practices from a variety of similar products
- AI also helps me make some small design decisions by searching through established design guidelines and standards, so that I don't need to consult a dictionary
