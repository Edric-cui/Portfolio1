## I'm Jiachen, a UX designer.

<!--
{% include carousel.html %}

I built this website to share a collection of my works with you.

This website is also a part of my portfolio, which I built on GitHub with Jekyll. It is **static**, **responsive**, **markdown-based** and **light-weight**.

I structured this site with HTML and styled it with CSS, with a pinch of JavaScript. Since this website is markdown-based, it can be maintained quickly and easily – all I need is a text editor and internet.
